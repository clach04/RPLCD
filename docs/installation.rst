Installation
############


From PyPI
=========

You can install RPLCD directly from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPLCD/>`_ using pip::

    $ sudo pip install RPLCD

If you want to use IÂ²C, you also either the smbus or `smbus2 <https://pypi.org/project/smbus2/>`_ library::

    $ sudo apt install python-smbus
    or
    $ sudo pip install smbus2

RPLCD will first try to use smbus if available and if not, fall back to smbus2.

If you want to use pigpio, the easiest way is to install the library via your
packet manager (select the Python version you need)::

    $ sudo apt-get install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio


Manual Installation
===================

You can also install the library manually without pip. Either just copy the
scripts to your working directory and import them, or download the repository
and run ``python setup.py install`` to install it into your Python package
directory.
